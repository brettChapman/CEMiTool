A modified version of the Co-Expression Module Identification Tool (CEMiTool) (modified by Brett Chapman)

### Docker Image
For more information about using the official CEMiTool Docker image, see [here](docker/example.md)
The Dockerfile has been modified by Brett Chapman to utilise this GitHub repo

### Updates to this version of CEMiTool

New parameters have been added to the CEMiTool.R executable in exec/ and the script has been significantly updated.

Usage:
```--top_hubs N (default: 10)``` to output the top N hub genes to use for the basis of the interaction network, list of hub genes per module, and a filtered expression matrix is also output for use in other tools if desired.

Another parameter included which was left out from the original executable is ```--cor-function=<corfunc>```

A python script has also been included which converts GFF to a GMT file if wanting to generate a gene set for ORA analysis. Modification of the python script may be nessary depending on the formatting of your GFF file. A test.gff file has been included in tests/.

Please use this version of CEMiTool is you would like to run CEMiTool on a cluster with the executable through Docker or Singularity instead of RStudio, and if you would like to see a list of the top hub genes, use these genes for the interaction network (if you don't have a interactome of your own), and would like to slice the original expression matrix by hub genes and transformed using VST.
